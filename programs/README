To compile the program, use:
	make [ftpclient]
where the ftpclient is not neccessary. Alternatively, compile the
src/ftpclient.c and src/string_t.c source files with gcc with your custom flags.
To run the program, use ./ftpclient server logfile [port], where server is the
server to which to connect, the log file is the file in which log reports will
be written, and port is optional and tells the client to which port to try to
connect.

Here is a list of the available commands and their formats, where [] parts are
optional and all else is required.
	cd directory - sends CWD directory to server
	cdup - sends CDUP to server
	ls [file or directory name] - sends LIST or LIST of file/dir name
	get server_file [local file]
	pwd - sends PWD to server
	help [help list] - sends HELP to the server
	quit - sends QUIT to the server and shuts the program down
	passive - toggles the "passive" flag, i.e., whether to use PASV (in passive
		mode) or PORT (in non-passive/active mode) Upon logging in, defaults to PORT first
	extended - "extended" flag; if true, forces the use of IPv6 for EPSV and
		EPRT. Defaults first to false and then to either true or false depending
		on whether the client program could find any IPv4 or IPv6 addresses

Note that the "extended" mode does not exactly work, however. When in active
mode, the client will make an "EPRT" request to the server, which occasionally
gets a positive response, but the server will never connect to the client. For
the time being, additionally, extended mode has not been implemented in passive
mode. The client will use "PASV" no matter the value of the "extended" flag.

A sample run can be found in the samples/sample_log, for all commands, with
variations on all of them, including failures and successes. Also, at the
bottom, an example of an EPRT command can be found. On occasion, this command
would get a "successful" response, but then a connection would never be made,
but on this occassion, a response was never received.

Also, I know gotos have a bad reputation, but I wanted to experiment with a new,
common-in-C error-handling paradigm for this assignment, and they seem to have
worked fairly well.
